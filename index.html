      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>While Bob Dylan is personally one of my favorite artists of all time, he is also one of the most famous artists of all time. He’s widely considered to be one of the best lyricists of all-time, through his signature style of cryptic yet provocative poetry.</p>

      <p>In some cases, his songs were received by fans as protest anthems. Many called Dylan “the voice of a generation,” but he himself never overtly welcomed this title. Like his lyrics, Dylan was cryptic about the point of his music. He’s notorious for being resistant and vague in press interviews, as he felt that the media was trying to put him in a box. And throughout his career, Dylan seemed to actively avoid any type-casting, both personally and musically.</p>

      <p>Dylan’s go-to instruments are the guitar and the harmonica, which helped him achieve what he once described as a “wild, thin mercury sound.” Starting out as an exclusively folk artist, Dylan eventually experimented with sounds from rock and gospel through his inclusion of the electric guitar and the organ. He never married himself to any one sound, to the dismay of his fans.</p>

      <p>When Dylan released “Like a Rolling Stone,” his performances were often met with boos from folk-loyalists who felt that Dylan had sold out. But this didn’t stop him. He continued to experiment, which allowed for his music to resonate with audiences to this day in a way most artists can’t match.</p>
